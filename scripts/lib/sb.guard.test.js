/**
 * The guard that keeps the retry policy from re-diverging.
 *
 * The 2026-09-05 incident was not really a Supabase stall — it was seventeen
 * scheduled scripts each with their own idea of what a failed Supabase request
 * means. That is why a fix lands in one place and the next stall surfaces
 * somewhere else, and why "the NFL lab is broken too" looked like a second,
 * separate regression when it was the same one.
 *
 * A fix you have to remember to apply is not a fix. So this test enumerates the
 * scripts the workflows actually run and fails the build if one of them talks to
 * Supabase without going through scripts/lib/sb.mjs. Adding a new scheduled
 * script that hand-rolls a fetch now breaks CI on the first commit, rather than
 * on the first outage six weeks later.
 *
 * If a script legitimately needs a raw fetch, add it to ALLOWED with a reason.
 * The list is meant to stay short; each entry is a place the next stall can still
 * reach.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run
