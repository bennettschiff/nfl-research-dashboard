/**
 * scripts/lib/sb.mjs — the one place a scheduled job talks to Supabase.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * On 2026-09-05 the shared instance stalled for ~8 minutes: PostgREST's own
 * session setup (`SET client_encoding`) hit the statement timeout and every
 * request came back 504 after 135-180 s. THIS repo's nightly backup died inside
 * that window on `teams`, a 36-row table, and the MLB lab's analyst job died in
 * the same minutes — two repos, two error messages, one cause, which read like
 * two unrelated regressions.
 *
 * That is the actual bug. Every script having its own `sb()` is why a fix lands
 * in one place and the next stall surfaces somewhere else — the "fix and break,
 * repair fix and break" loop. So: one helper, one retry policy, one test suite,
 * and a guard test (sb.guard.test.js) that fails the build if a scheduled script
 * starts talking to /rest/v1/ with a bare fetch again.
 *
 * SIBLING COPIES. mlb-research-dashboard carries this file verbatim; wnba-research-dashboard has
 * the same policy under scripts/lib/sb-fetch.mjs, which it grew first for the
 * 2026-08-25 PGRST002 incident. Three repos, no shared package, so a change to
 * the policy belongs in all three. The guard in each repo is what stops a NEW
 * script drifting; it does not keep the three copies in step, and nothing does.
 *
 * POLICY
 *
 * - Retry 408, 429, 5xx, and network/timeout errors. Those are the instance
 *   being unavailable; the request is still valid.
 * - Never retry other 4xx. A bad query, a bad key, a missing table — retrying
 *   only turns a clear error into a slow one.
 * - GET and HEAD retry by default: they are idempotent.
 * - Anything else does NOT retry unless the caller passes `idempotent: true`.
 *   This is the important one. mlb_picks has no unique key but `id`, so a
 *   retried plain INSERT that actually landed duplicates the slate. Pass
 *   `idempotent` only for an upsert (`on_conflict=`), a DELETE, or a
 *   PATCH/PUT addressed by primary key — all of which land the same answer
 *   whether they run once or three times.
 * - Every request carries a timeout, so a socket the server never closes can't
 *   hold a job open until the workflow's own timeout kills it.
 *
 * Backoff totals ~2.6 minutes, which covers the stalls this instance has
 * actually produced. Jobs that can afford to wait longer pass their own.
